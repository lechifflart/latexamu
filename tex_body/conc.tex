The scope of this thesis was to reproduce and predict PL spectra of different hBN nanostructures and provide an insightful interpretation of the different features appearing in experimental measurements thanks to first-principles calculations of the exciton-phonon coupling.



first time a PL spectrum was published with both direct and phonon-assisted contributions with their relative intensities accounted for from \acrshort{MBPT}

perspectives
need to solve the phase problem 
natural extension to cumulant for multi phonons ; cumulant also for temperature dependence of exciton energies and optical spectra on the same footing

% 
perspective : it should be possible to obtain excitonic temperature from the exciton-phonon coupling via a exciton conversion rate to see how fast they thermalize.

perspectives
need to solve the phase problem 
natural extension to cumulant for multi phonons

Bernal : pave to way to engineering of optical properties with exciton valley positions
% 
perspective : it should be possible to obtain excitonic temperature from the exciton-phonon coupling via a exciton conversion rate to see how fast they thermalize.
ab inito exc-ph coupling = lifetimes, diffusion and dynamics
